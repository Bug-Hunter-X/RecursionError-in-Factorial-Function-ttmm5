# RecursionError in Python Factorial Function

This repository demonstrates a common programming error in Python:  handling recursive functions without properly accounting for edge cases.  Specifically, the example showcases a `factorial` function that fails to handle negative input, leading to a `RecursionError`.

The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version.
